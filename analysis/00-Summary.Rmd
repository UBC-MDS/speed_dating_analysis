# Summary

This research delves into the dynamics of self-perceived attractiveness in the context of dating. We explore whether individuals accurately gauge their own appeal compared to external judgments. Analyzing data from speed dating studies, the findings reveal a systematic tendency for individuals to overestimate their attractiveness. While a significant correlation exists between self-ratings and others' ratings, this research underscores the interplay between self-perception and external judgments in the realm of dating. The implications range from improved self-esteem for those perceiving themselves as more attractive to potential challenges in social interactions. Future research could investigate the influence of contemporary factors like social media on self-perception and exploring the multidimensional aspects of attractiveness.
