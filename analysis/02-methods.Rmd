## Data

The dataset used in this project were obtained from a series of speed dating studies led by Dr. Ray Fisman and Dr. Sheena Iyengar conducted between 2002 and 2004 at Columbia University (Fisman et al., 2006). Data were collected across 21 different sessions (known as “waves” in the dataset). Data was sourced from OpenML (Vanschoren et al., 2014) and can be found ![here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/speed.dating/).

In the experiment, men and women went on a speed dating rotation where they interacted and subsequently rated each other on 6 attributes: attractive, sincere, intelligent, fun, ambitious, and shared interest/hobbies. Critically, they were also asked to report whether they would see this person again or not. In addition to rating the other party, each participant also rated themselves on 5 of the 6 attributes (attractive, sincere, intelligent, fun, ambitious). Specifically, they were asked to rate how they measured up to each attribute, as well as how they thought others perceived them.

An observation or row in the data represents one set of ratings per ratee. For instance, if an individual saw 10 different partners in the session, then that individual would make 10 different ratings, one for each partner they interacted with at the event.


## Analysis

We conducted a one-sample t-test to answer our research question (whether self-perception of attractiveness is accurate). Since observations in the original raw dataset violated assumptions of independence (i.e., each rater made multiple ratings and each ratee received multiple ratings), we decided to first process the data by averaging how each rater rated the attractiveness of each ratee. We then calculated a difference score by subtracting how others perceived an individual’s attractiveness from an individual’s rating of their own perceived attractiveness by others (i.e., own perception – other perception). As such, a positive score indicates that an individual was overly confident in their own perceived attractiveness.

Analysis and graphs were produced using the R programming language (R Core Team 2019) as well as the following R packages: tidyverse (Wickham 2019), knitr (Xie 2023), here (Müller 2020).
